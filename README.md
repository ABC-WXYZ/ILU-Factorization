This is a collection of Python codes for ILU Factorization of large, sparse square matrices, based on the original 1994 paper by Y. Saad.
It consists of functions for ILU(0), ILU(k) and dual-threshold based ILU. Currently, all the codes are running well but I need to add documentation and make them easier to import. 
I plan to do that soon after the end-semester exams, immediately after 7th December. I will also translate it to C++ and utilise Compressed matrices. 
You may look at the presentation for detailed information about pseudocode, theory, performance etc.

WORK DONE AS PART OF RESEARCH PROJECT FOR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING AT IIITD, MONSOON '25
