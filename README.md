This is a collection of Python codes for ILU Factorization of large, sparse square matrices, based on the original 1994 paper by Y. Saad.
It consists of functions for ILU(0), ILU(k) and dual-threshold based ILU. Currently, all the codes are running well but I need to add documentation and make them easier to import. 
I plan to do that soon after the end-semester exams, immediately after 7th December. I will also translate it to C++ and utilise Compressed matrices.
